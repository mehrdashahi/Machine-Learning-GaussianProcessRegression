# Machine-Learning-GaussianProcessRegression
Predicting household price using gaussian process regression models

This project is created for assignment 3 for the course STA414, taught by professor Salakhutdinov. 

We are given dataset on median 
housing prices in various small survey regions of the United States. We apply gaussian process regression models  and compare how well the models predict test cases for different forms of the covariance function, when hyperparameters
of the covariance function are set by maximizing marginal likelihood, by cross validation, or
by averaging over their posterior distribution.
